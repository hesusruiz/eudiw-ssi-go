# EUDW-SSI-Go (eIDAS2 and EUDI Wallet Aligned Go Library)

# Introduction

The original `ssi-sdk` is very good, but it was archived at the end of 2024 and is unmaintained. Other options, including the one recommended by the original authors [web5-go](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/web5-go), are either not well maintained or not aligned with the EU eIDAS2 Regulation. This can be seen, among many other things, in the lack of support for secp256r1 in `web5-go` and related did methods.

After analyzing the possibility of contributing to those other projects, we have taken the decission to fork the TBD54566975 `ssi-sdk` repo, which already provides a better base for eIDAS2 alignment.

Most references to `ssi-sdk` in this README an other documentation should be understood as references to `eudiw-ssi-go`, unless the implies a reference to the original repo. In the future, and to avoid confusions, the documentation will be updated accordingly.

Named `ssi-sdk`, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related
to [Self Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html).
The `ssi-sdk` intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building
decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.

The image above outlines the SDK's vision. Standards may be added and/or removed. The standards themselves are under
active development, and as such, are subject to change. When possible we aim to call out which versions or revisions of
standards we are building implementations against.

The SDK has not undergone any formal security review or audit, so please use with caution.

For more information, see the [vision document](doc/VISION.md).

# Building

This project uses [mage](https://magefile.org/), please
view [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

After installing mage, you can build and test the SDK with the following commands:

```

```

A utility is provided to run _clean, build, and test_ in sequence with:

```
mage cbt
```

# WASM
The ssi-sdk-wasm is a library that provides a WebAssembly (WASM) implementation for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) SDK. It enables SSI functionality in the browser and other JavaScript environments by compiling the SDK to a WASM file. This repository is responsible for building the main.wasm file and making it available as an npm package.

The wasm implemetation for this repo lives here - https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk-wasm
# Versioning

For information on versioning refer to our [versioning guide](doc/VERSIONING.md).

The latest version is...nothing! No releases have been made.

# Mobile

Using the [gomobile](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile) tool, we can generate a library that can be
used in mobile applications. For more information view the [mobile README](mobile/README.md).

# Examples
